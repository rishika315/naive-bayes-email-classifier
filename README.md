# naive-bayes-email-classifier
I created an email classification project using the Naive Bayes algorithm to categorize emails into predefined classes, such as spam or non-spam. By analyzing features like word frequency and patterns, the model effectively predicts the class of incoming emails. This approach enhances email filtering systems with high efficiency and accuracy.
